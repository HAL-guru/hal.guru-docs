The purpose behind hal.guru.

## The Future of Programming is Natural Language

In the AI era, programming shifts toward natural-language prompts that turn specifications
into executable intent—models orchestrate code, data, and tools with guardrails and hybrid stacks (natural language for intent, DSLs for precision, traditional code for performance) —-
while established methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, version control, CI/CD, testing,
and DevOps remain in place, refined through standards, reviews, and quality gates.

## Complex AI Agent Development Needs to be Simplified

Creating effective AI agents requires a deep understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector databases, and the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG combines a model’s generative abilities with relevant, retrieved context, reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy. A solid grasp of how LLMs process prompts, use attention, and can be fine‑tuned or steered via system instructions and tools is equally important. Together, these components allow you to design agents that are grounded in up‑to‑date knowledge, scalable, and reliable in real‑world applications.

## The UI Should Adapt to the User and Task Context

Imagine a StarTrek - inspired future in which the user interface materializes before our eyes—shaping, rearranging, and refining itself in real time based on how AI agents interpret and respond to our evolving needs.

## No‑Compromise Security, End‑to‑End

An AI platform should be security‑first: built on open standards to avoid lock‑in 
and integrate smoothly, with precise access control (RBAC) and per‑tenant isolation 
to protect every customer’s data. It should offer seamless Sign‑in with **Google** 
or **Microsoft** (including Azure **Active Directory**/Microsoft Entra ID) and **Single Sign‑On**,
plus **Two‑Factor Authentication** (TOTP, Passkeys/WebAuthn, SMS/Email) 
to raise security without adding friction. Continuous safeguards like rate limiting,
anti‑brute‑force, audit trails, and real‑time alerts reduce risk and speed response,
while built‑in GDPR and data‑retention features support compliance. 
Automated provisioning (SCIM) shortens onboarding and cuts errors. 
Deploy on your terms—on an Ubuntu server in your own infrastructure or in Kubernetes.
Running in your own environment guarantees that data remains within your defined geographic and contractual boundaries: you decide where it is stored, who can access it, and how it is logged and retained. 
This reduces regulatory risk, simplifies audits, and fulfills data‑sovereignty
commitments to customers.

## The solution

Therefore, we decided to create [hal.guru](../features/index.md) -- a platform for building AI agents designed to meet the challenges of the future. It empowers teams to prototype, deploy, and scale intelligent agents with reliability and speed, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications.

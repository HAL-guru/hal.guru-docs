The purpose behind hal.guru.

## Complex AI agent development needs to be simplified

Creating effective AI agents requires a deep understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector databases, and the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG combines a model’s generative abilities with relevant, retrieved context, reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy. A solid grasp of how LLMs process prompts, use attention, and can be fine‑tuned or steered via system instructions and tools is equally important. Together, these components allow you to design agents that are grounded in up‑to‑date knowledge, scalable, and reliable in real‑world applications.
<!-- Decribe cost of the implementation of AI agents in the real world -->

## The UI should adapt to the user and task context.

Imagine a StarTrek - inspired future in which the user interface materializes before our eyes—shaping, rearranging, and refining itself in real time based on how AI agents interpret and respond to our evolving needs.

## The natural-language shift in software development

In the AI era, programming shifts toward natural-language prompts that turn specifications 
into executable intent—models orchestrate code, data, and tools with guardrails and hybrid stacks 
(natural language for intent, DSLs for precision, traditional code for performance) —- 
while established methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, version control, CI/CD, testing, 
and DevOps remain in place, refined through standards, reviews, and quality gates.

## The solution

Therefore, we decided to create [hal.guru](../features/index.md) -- a platform for building AI agents designed to meet the challenges of the future. It empowers teams to prototype, deploy, and scale intelligent agents with reliability and speed, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications.

The purpose behind hal.guru.

## The Natural-Language Shift in Software Development

In the AI era, programming shifts toward natural-language prompts that turn specifications 
into executable intent—models orchestrate code, data, and tools with guardrails and hybrid stacks 
(natural language for intent, DSLs for precision, traditional code for performance) —- 
while established methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, version control, CI/CD, testing, 
and DevOps remain in place, refined through standards, reviews, and quality gates.

## The solution

Therefore, we decided to create [hal.guru](../features/index.md) -- a platform for building AI agents designed to meet the challenges of the future. It empowers teams to prototype, deploy, and scale intelligent agents with reliability and speed, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications.

An AI Agents solution must be security‑first. From day one,
it should protect your users, data, and brand—while making access simple and compliant.
That’s why it needs enterprise‑grade identity built on open standards,
so partners and internal apps connect easily without lock‑in or custom workarounds.

## Per‑Tenant Separation, Roles, and SSO

You should control exactly who can do what, with clear roles and per‑tenant
separation to keep every customer’s data isolated by design.
Users can sign in with **Google** or **Microsoft** (including Azure **Active Directory**/Microsoft
Entra ID) and enjoy Single Sign‑On across your tools. **Two‑Factor Authentication** (TOTP,
Passkeys/WebAuthn, SMS/Email codes) increases protection without adding
friction—reducing support tickets and boosting satisfaction.

## From Brute‑Force Defense to GDPR

Security should be continuous and visible: automatic defenses against brute‑force
attacks, smart rate limits, detailed audit trails for every login and token action,
and real‑time alerts for critical events (like account lock or MFA enrollment).
Compliance must be built‑in with data retention policies and GDPR capabilities
(right to erasure and data export). Automated provisioning (SCIM)
speeds onboarding and cuts errors.

## On‑Prem or Kubernetes with Full Data Sovereignty

Deploy on your terms—on an **Linux Ubuntu** server in your own infrastructure or in **Kubernetes** for high availability and scale—meeting security, compliance, and data‑residency needs 
while lowering total cost of ownership. Running in your own environment guarantees 
that data remains within your defined geographic and contractual boundaries: 
you decide where it is stored, who can access it, and how it is logged and retained. 
This reduces regulatory risk, simplifies audits, and fulfills data‑sovereignty
commitments to customers. Leveraging your private networks and existing controls 
(VPCs, firewalls, SIEM, KMS/HSM) further limits exposure and accelerates 
incident response. You gain full cost transparency and can reuse current investments 
in monitoring, backup, and capacity planning—avoiding data egress fees and vendor lock‑in.

## The solution

Therefore, we decided to create [hal.guru](../features/index.md) -- a platform for building AI agents designed to meet the challenges of the future. It empowers teams to prototype, deploy, and scale intelligent agents with reliability and speed, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications.

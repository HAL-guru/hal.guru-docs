The `halguru` CLI is a robust, user-friendly command-line toolkit for defining, building, testing, publishing, and managing AI agents for the hal.guru platform. It streamlines the agent lifecycle through intuitive commands and YAML-based configurations, enabling customization and seamless deployment. 

With deep platform integration, users can publish agents, check statuses, list available agents, and keep configurations synchronized. The CLI also offers comprehensive file handling (upload, download, delete, list) and rich testing, debugging, and troubleshooting outputs, providing clear insights into agent performance and behavior.

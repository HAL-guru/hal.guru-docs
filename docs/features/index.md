## Creating AI agents in your favorite IDE

You can edit AI agent configuration files with any text editor, but we recommend **Visual Studio Code** for its schema-based autocompletion, real-time validation with clear errors, hover hints and inline docs, quick fixes and snippets, and seamless setup that auto-installs and maps [YAML schemas](../schemas/index.md) -- making editing faster, safer, and less error-prone; if you prefer another editor, you can manually install and map the YAML schemas (e.g., via a YAML language server) to get similar benefits like completion, validation, and tailored hints.
[Details](yaml-editor.md)

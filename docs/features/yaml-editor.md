You can edit AI agent configuration files with any text editor, but we recommend **Visual Studio Code**. It offers schema‑based autocompletion, inline validation, and helpful command suggestions by automatically installing and activating YAML schemas for your agent files. This makes editing faster, safer, and less error‑prone.

With VS Code you get:

- Smart autocompletion for YAML keys and values, driven by the schema of your agent files
- Real‑time validation with clear error messages
- Hover hints and inline documentation for available fields
- Quick fixes and snippets to speed up common edits
- Seamless setup: the recommended extension can auto‑configure the YAML schemas for you

Prefer a different editor? That’s fine —- [YAML schemas](../schemas/index.md) can be installed and mapped manually in most popular editors (e.g., by enabling a YAML language server and pointing it to the appropriate schema files). Once configured, you’ll get similar benefits: completion, validation, and hints tailored to your agent configuration.

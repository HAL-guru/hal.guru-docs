title: Configuration Files for AI Agents
description:
author: Chris Prusik

We use YAML files to define the structure of AI agents, persist their runtime state, specify the actions they can execute, and configure web scraping workflows. This approach keeps configurations human-readable, versionable, and easy to validate, while separating logic from data for cleaner, more maintainable systems.

<!--
YAML schemas define the structure, allowed fields, data types, and validation rules for 
AI Agent configurations. 
By describing what a valid configuration should look like, schemas help catch errors early, 
ensure consistency across environments, and enable richer tooling such as auto-completion, 
linting, and documentation hints in editors. 

They also make configurations more maintainable and self-descriptive, 
improving collaboration between teams. 
In practice, a schema acts as a contract that both authors and automated systems 
can rely on when creating, validating, and processing YAML files.

## Agent Configuration

An agent supports toggleable behaviors that define goals, tone, constraints, and switching commands, with the most recently activated behavior taking precedence on conflicts. A complete configuration includes prompts, LLM connectors, RAG integrations, safety and usage policies, UX/persona, secrets, metadata, testing/validation, and operational settings (rate limits, error handling).
